## Raw Data Sharing in Metabolomics PLOS ONE Papers

PLOS ONE is a pioneering journal in requiring data sharing and data availability statements, having had its current policy since March 2014. However, in out previous research ([Spicer *et al.* (2018)](https://doi.org/10.1007/s11306-017-1309-5)), it was found that in the period January 2015 - September 2017 only 12 PLOS ONE journal articles were directly linked to raw metabolomics data hosted by dedicated repositories, depsite ~400 metabolomics papers being published in this time period. This finding surpised us, and in this subsequent research we investigated potential reasons for it: whether researchers share raw data by means other than metabolomics specific repositories, if PLOS ONE publishes a high percentage of clinical studies, or whether it appears that the standard within the metabolomics community is to share processed data.
